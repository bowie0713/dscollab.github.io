On the sunny afternoon of Tuesday, October 24th, from 4:00 to 5:00 pm, we had the delightful opportunity to host an Ice Cream Social for our Data Science Collaborative members at Storke Lawn, UCSB. This event aimed to foster connections among students, providing a platform for them to socialize, meet potential project collaborators, and connect with mentors or mentees. During the social, we offered a variety of ice cream treats, including classic Kirkland chocolate options and vegan alternatives. The event had a successful turnout, with students mingling, making new acquaintances, and nurturing a strong sense of the data science community through this enjoyable gathering.

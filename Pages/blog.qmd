<h3>Professor Speaker Panel</h3>
<h5>Monday, April 8, 2024 @ Arts Building 1349</h5>

<p>
On Monday, April 8th, at the UCSB Arts Building, we had the honor of hosting two esteemed professors in Statistics and Data Science, Dr. Katie Coburn and Dr. Rituparna Sen, for our Professor Panel event in collaboration with UCSBâ€™s Delta Sigma Pi. Throughout the panel, both professors shared their experiences and perspectives on Statistics and Data Science and offered insights into the current industry landscape, as well as advice on pursuing an academic career or extended education in the field. A highlight of the event was the emphasis placed on pursuing an academic route within Statistics and Data Science. Dr. Coburn and Dr. Sen provided invaluable insights into the academic journey, discussing topics such as graduate studies, research opportunities, and the importance of mentorship in shaping one's scholarly pursuits. Approximately 40 students were able to get questions answered and gain a deeper understanding and inspiration for their academic and professional endeavors in Statistics and Data Science.

On Friday, January 19th, at UCSB's North Hall, we had the pleasure of hosting speaker Carlo Broderick, who received a Master's degree in environmental data science at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. He came to speak about MOSAIKS (Multi-task Observation using Satellite Imagery & Kitchen Sinks), a new approach to analyzing satellite imagery with machine learning, for our Data Science Collaborative members.

The event provided a valuable opportunity for our curious-minded members to delve into the intricacies of MOSAIKS and its transformative potential. Carlo elucidated how MOSAIKS transforms satellite images into tabular data (features). One of the most remarkable aspects highlighted was MOSAICS' remarkable ability to generalize across diverse tasks using a unified set of features, ensuring accessibility and effectiveness across a broad spectrum of applications.

Through engaging with Carlo during the speaker event, our members gained a deeper understanding of MOSAICS' underlying principles and its practical implications. Carlo's expertise and passion for leveraging machine learning to address real-world challenges shone through, inspiring our members to explore the intersection of data science and environmental analysis further.

On the sunny afternoon of Tuesday, October 24th, from 4:00 to 5:00 pm, we had the delightful opportunity to host an Ice Cream Social for our Data Science Collaborative members at Storke Lawn, UCSB. This event aimed to foster connections among students, providing a platform for them to socialize, meet potential project collaborators, and connect with mentors or mentees. During the social, we offered a variety of ice cream treats, including classic Kirkland chocolate options and vegan alternatives. The event had a successful turnout, with students mingling, making new acquaintances, and nurturing a strong sense of the data science community through this enjoyable gathering.
